# Makoto Investments Website
Static website for Makoto Investments Ltd. built using HTML, CSS, and javascript. 

Some frameworks I used are JQuery and Bootstrap 4.

# TO-DO

This website is pretty bare-bones and not very clean. These are some tasks that I would like to take care of:<br>
1) find a way to reallocate the Calendly API calls into seperate js files instead of pasting them at the bottom of all pages
2) consolidate CSS
3) possibly consider restructuring the website framework to have a back end w/ nodeJS & esj instead of a front-end only static website
  - consider forking to make w/ React
4) add more here...
